<p align="center"><b>Potholes Detection (PhD)</b></p>

<p align="center">
A 2021 Bangkit Program project in the form of an Android application that connects with the Raspberry Pi to detect potholes while driving and then sends the potholes data along with its location to JAKI

## Summary

<p align="justify"> Slow and inaccurate process of handling public complaints to the government, specifically about potholes, so the road is not repaired immediately is the background of our project idea. Our application will record the road that the driver is traveling in real-time, then can detect which part of the road has holes in it. After the trip ends, the user can view the image report and verify whether the part of the road detected by machine learning is correct and send it automatically along with its location to JAKI. </p>
